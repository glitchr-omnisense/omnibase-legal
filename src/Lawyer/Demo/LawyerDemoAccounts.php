/**
 * The demonstration accounts of a law firm (glitchr/omnibase's `demo`
 * environment): one for each role the profile and omnibase/office know. The
 * roles of the firm come from two groups, as in a real one - "Avocats"
 * (ROLE_LAWYER) and "Secrétariat" (ROLE_SECRETARY), both ROLE_STAFF through
 * the application's role hierarchy; "cabinet" is the firm's administrator.
 *
 * An application's fixtures take them from Base\Demo\DemoAccountFactory
 * ($accounts->account('avocate', $manager)) and attach what makes them worth
 * signing in as: a member of the team and an agenda to the lawyers, a request
 * and documents in the vault to the client. A firm without one of these
 * roles (a lawyer practising alone has no associate) leaves it out:
 * base.demo.exclude.
 *
 * Registered when the installed glitchr/omnibase has the demo environment
 * (config/services.php).
